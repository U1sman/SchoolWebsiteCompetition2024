                <p class="p1">In modern agriculture, automation plays a pivotal role by enhancing efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. By embracing technological advancements, farmers can unlock the full potential of their land and resources, significantly improving their overall agricultural operations. The historical context of automation in farming practices reveals a long evolution of mechanization. Mechanization, defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), encompasses the use of machinery and equipment in agricultural operations, ranging from basic hand tools to sophisticated motorized machinery. As we progress from basic hand tools to motorized equipment, the degree of automation increases. The automation process involves three essential phases: diagnosis, decision-making, and performing. Advanced technologies allow all three phases to be entirely automated, as seen in fruit-harvesting robots that perform diagnosis, decision-making, and actual harvesting. Meanwhile, producers monitor sensors and maintain the equipment. From Agriculture 1.0 (relying on manual labor and animal power</p>
